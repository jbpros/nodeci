# THIS IS AN EXPERIMENT - Not tested, ugly code

This is my first attempt at writing Node.js code. Untested, crappy code.

It proved to work and I'm working on a real project which should get live in March 2011.  

# Nodeci

Continuous Integration server based on Node.js.

## Description

Nodeci is a [Continuous Integration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration
"Continuous Integration definition on Wikipedia") server. It features
a web interface with distributed realtime results.

Builds are
simple shell commands. Their exit code determines the build result ("0"
means success, anything else is a failure).

## Installation

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/ "Node.js official website") is required.

    $ git clone <nodeci-repos>
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    
## Configuration

All you need to configure is the build command you want to run and the
arguments for it. Nodeci listens on 0.0.0.0:8126 by default.

Configuration is stored in `config/nodeci_config.js`:

    var options = {
        hostname: "0.0.0.0",
        port: 8126,
        name: "Project",
        build: {
            command: '/bin/bash',
            args:    ['-l', './bash_cukes']
        }     
    };
    module.exports = options;
